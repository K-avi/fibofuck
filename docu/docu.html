            <h2><u>I: Introduction</u></h2>
            <p>
                Fibofuck is a <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">brainfuck</a> like <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language" target="_blank">Esolang</a>. It's goal is to  
                be a <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">brainfuck<a> where the environment is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap" target="_blank">fibonnaci heap</a>
                instead of a list/array.
                However for the sake of minimalism and simplicity the language doesn't use n-ary trees like regular 
                fibonacci heaps would. 
                Instead each tree in the heap is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_heap" target="_blank">Skew heap</a>.
                The language's lexic and syntax are very similar to <a href=" https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">brainfuck</a>.  
                Some <a href=" https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">brainfuck</a> instructions are also redefined to make sense 
                in the context of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)" target="_blank">heap</a> (cf documentation of <code>,</code> , <code>&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;</code>)

            <h2><u>II: Environment</u></h2>
            <div id="p21">
                <h4><em>II.1: General presentation</em></h4>
                <p class="text-left">
                        The environment of fibofuck is a heap similar in concept to a fibo heap.
                        The key difference being that trees in the heap are implemented as binary skew heap. 
                        Which means that no node has more than two children. 
                        The tree is implemented this way to make the language more simple (n-ary tree support would have 
                        made a more complex syntax necessary).
                        At the beginning of the program, the heap is 
                        empty. The maximal size of the heap is theoretically infinite. 
                        Each node of the heap contains a signed integer.
                        Note that the structure of the fibo heap is always maintained and that the heap is updated after 
                        each instruction.
                        This means that the heap is really "merge heavy". This is one of the differences between a regular 
                        Fibo heap and the heap in fibofuck. In a regular fibo heap, the merge call is often only done after 
                        deletion of an element. Here it's done after every instruction making the whole environment very chaotic.
        
                        Another important detail is that the tree follow the merge operation of skew heaps. This means that 
                        their right and left branch will get swapped after a merge. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="p22">
                <h4><em>II.1: Behavior of operations</em></h4>
                <p class="text-left">
                    The behavior of every operation on the fibo heap will be documented here: 
                    <ul>
                    <li>merge : Mix of skew heap AND fibo heap. Applies the skew heap merge operation on 2 trees of the same size (number of nodes) until
                         every tree in the heap is of different size</li>
                    <li>insert node: comes from fibo heap. Adds a node to the heap and then calls merge</li>
                    <li>delete node : comes from fibo heap. Deletes a node from a tree. If it has children 
                        insert it's children in the heap as new trees and then call merge</li>
                    <li>delete tree: deletes a tree from the heap</li>
                    <li>decrease key : comes from skew heap. Decrease a key in a tree and then heapifies it</li>
                    <li>increase key : comes from skew heap. Increase a key in a tree and then heapifies it</li>
                    </ul>

                    What I find interresting about this is that the environment is merge heavy which means that 
                    it's hard to predict how it's gonna evolve after insertion or deletion.

            <h2><u>III: Instructions</u></h2>
            <p>
                fibofuck accepts brainfuck like instruction adapted to the fibonacci heap structure. 
                The behavior of some bf-like instruction is changed to be more suited for heap manipulation. 
                Noe that after every instruction the environment will restructure itself to 
                remain a fibonacci heap. 
                If the heap is empty, every instruction other than the creation of nodes will be ignored.
                NB: Every character that isn't an instruction is ignored.

            <p>
                This paragraph attempts to show that brainfuck can be simulated in fibofuck. 
                To do so we have to setup a specific heap where the root of each tree is set to 0 
                and each of their children is set to an arbitrary high number (superior to 256).
                A way to achieve that is to initialise a tree of size 1 , one of size 2 ,.... one of size n   
                <br/>By creating such a heap of arbitrary size. The behavior of the <code>+</code> , <code>-</code> , 
                <code>[</code> , <code>]</code> , <code>&lt;</code> , <code>&gt;</code> , <code>.</code> is the exact same 
                as the behavior of their brainfuck counterpart.
