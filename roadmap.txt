set up the manipulation of 

-> skew heaps 
    -skew heaps prolly done; need to check edge cases of popNode

-> list of tree roots for fibo heap 
    -using a doubly linked list is actually stupid 
    -I'll put these bad boys in a dynamic array and that'll be better
	-> popping a node will be wayyyyyyy simpler and so on 

-> implement the fibo heap proper 
    -the structure will be simple enough 
    -the interresting bit is the merge function cuz it'll have to be weird


once all of this is done with move on to tuning parsing n then exec

at least the docu is done ig lol
