fibofuck is kind of a follow up project to heapfuck . 

It's heapfuck but worse (better). Instead of manipulating a binary heap like a baby the 
environment is a fibonnacci heap (christ).

needless to say it'll reuse most of it's code from heapfuck (which reuses the (SIASL)Â² code )

the only part that'll be very different is the actual fibonnacci heap implementation (duh)
